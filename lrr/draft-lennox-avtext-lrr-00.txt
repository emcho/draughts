   Refresh Request" (LRR), which can be used to request a state refresh
   of one or more substreams of a layered media stream.  It also defines

1.  Introduction

   This memo describes an RTP Payload-Specific Feedback Message "Layer
   Refresh Request" (LRR).  It is designed to allow a receiver of a
   layered media stream to request that one or more of its substreams be
   refreshed, such that it can then be decoded by an endpoint which
   previously was not receiving lose layers, without requiring that the
   entire stream be refreshed (as it would be if the receiver sent a
   Full Intra Request (FIR) [RFC5104].

   The message is designed to be applicable both to temporally and
   spatially scaled streams, and to both single-stream and multi-stream
   scalability modes.

2.  Conventions, Definitions and Acronyms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Terminology

   A "Layer Refresh Point" is a point in a scalable stream after which a
   decoder, which previously had been able to decode only some (possibly
   none) of the available layers of stream, is able to decode a greater
   number of the layers.

   For spatial (or quality) layers, layer refresh typically requires
   that a spatial layer be encoded in a way that references only lower-
   layer subpictures of the current picture, not any earlier pictures of
   that spatial layer.  Additionally, the encoder must promise that no

   earlier pictures of that spatial layer will be used as reference in
   the future.

   An illustration of spatial layer refresh is shown below.

        ... <--  S1  <--  S1       S1  <--  S1  <-- ...
                  |        |        |        |
                 \/       \/       \/       \/
        ... <--  S0  <--  S0  <--  S0  <--  S0  <-- ...

                  1        2        3        4

   In this illustration, frame 3 is a layer refresh point for spatial
   layer S1; a decoder which had previously only been decoding spatial
   layer S0 would be able to decode layer S1 starting at frame 3.

                                 Figure 1

   For temporal layers, layer refresh requires that the layer be
   "temporally nested", i.e. use as reference only earlier frames of a
   lower temporal layer, not any earlier frames of this temporal layer,
   and also promise that no future frames of this temporal layer will
   reference frames of this temporal layer before the refresh point.  In
   many cases, the temporal structure of the stream will mean that all
   frames are temporally nested, in which case decoders will have no
   need to send LRR messages for the stream.

   An illustration of temporal layer refresh is shown below.

           ...  <----- T1  <------ T1          T1  <------ ...
                      /           /           /
                    |_          |_          |_
        ... <--  T0  <------ T0  <------ T0  <------ T0  <--- ...

                  1     2     3     4     5     6     7

   In this illustration, frame 6 is a layer refresh point for spatial
   layer T1; a decoder which had previously only been decoding temporal
   layer T0 would be able to decode layer T1 starting at frame 6.

   An illustration of an inherently temporally nested stream is shown
   below.

                       T1          T1          T1
                      /           /           /
                    |_          |_          |_
        ... <--  T0  <------ T0  <------ T0  <------ T0  <--- ...

                  1     2     3     4     5     6     7

   In this illustration, the stream is temporally nested in its ordinary
   structure; a decoder receiving layer T0 can begin decoding layer T1
   at any point.

3.  Layer Refresh Request

   A layer refresh frame can be requested by sending a LRR, which is an
   RTCP feedback message asking the encoder to encode a frame which
   makes it possible to upgrade to a higher layer.  The LRR contains one
   or two tuples, indicating the layer the decoder wants to upgrade to,
   and (optionally) the currently highest layer the decoder can decode.

   The specific format of the tuples, and the mechanism by which a
   receiver recognizes a refresh frame, is codec-dependent.

   The FIR message is identified by RTCP packet type value PT=PSFB and
   FMT=4.  The FCI field MUST contain one or more FIR entries.  Each
   entry applies to a different media sender, identified by its SSRC.

   Editor's Note: The message described in this section is applicable to
   other codecs beyond just VP9.  In the future it will be likely be
   split out into another document.

   TODO: details of how this is encoded in RTCP.

   A synchronization frame can be requested by sending a LRR, which is
   an RTCP feedback message asking the encoder to encode a frame which
   makes it possible to upgrade to a higher layer.  The LRR message
   contains two tuples, {T1,S1,Q1} and {T2,S2,Q2}, where the first tuple
   is the currently highest layer the decoder can decode, while the
   second tuple is the layer the decoder wants to upgrade to.

   Identification of an upgrade frame can be derived from the reference
   IDs of each frame by backtracking the dependency chain until reaching
   a point where only decodable frames are being referenced.  Therefore
   it's recommended both for both the flexible and the non-flexible mode

   that, when upgrade frames are being encoded in response to a LRR,
   those packets should contain layer indices and the reference fields
   so that the decoder or an MCU can make this derivation.

   Example:

   LRR {1,1,0}, {1,2,1} is sent by an MCU when it is currently relaying
   {1,1,0} to a receiver and which wants to upgrade to {1,2,1}. In
   response the encoder should encode the next frames in layers {1,1,1}
   and {1,2,1} by only referring to frames in {1,1,0}, {1,0,0} or
   {0,0,0}.

   In the non-flexible mode, periodic upgrade frames can be defined by
   the layer structure of the SS, thus periodic upgrade frames can be
   automatically identified by the picture ID.

4.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550], and in any applicable RTP profile.  The main
   security considerations for the RTP packet carrying the RTP payload
   format defined within this memo are confidentiality, integrity and
   source authenticity.  Confidentiality is achieved by encryption of
   the RTP payload.  Integrity of the RTP packets through suitable
   cryptographic integrity protection mechanism.  Cryptographic system
   may also allow the authentication of the source of the payload.  A
   suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload format should
   provide confidentiality, integrity protection and at least source
   authentication capable of determining if an RTP packet is from a
   member of the RTP session or not.  Note that the appropriate
   mechanism to provide security to RTP and payloads following this memo
   may vary.  It is dependent on the application, the transport, and the
   signaling protocol employed.  Therefore a single mechanism is not
   sufficient, although if suitable the usage of SRTP [RFC3711] is
   recommended.  This RTP payload format and its media decoder do not
   exhibit any significant non-uniformity in the receiver-side
   computational complexity for packet processing, and thus are unlikely
   to pose a denial-of-service threat due to the receipt of pathological
   data.  Nor does the RTP payload format contain any active content.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to register the following values:
   - TODO.
