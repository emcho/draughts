          The Layer Intra Request (LIR) RTCP Feedback Message
                      draft-uberti-payload-vp9-00

Abstract

   This memo describes the RTP Payload-Specific Feedback Message "Layer
   Intra Request", which can be used to request a state refresh of one
   or more substreams of a layered media stream.  It also defines its
   use with several scalable media formats.

1.  Introduction

   This memo describes an RTP payload specification applicable to the
   transmission of video streams encoded using the VP9 video codec
   [I-D.grange-vp9-bitstream].  The format described in this document
   can be used both in peer-to-peer and video conferencing applications.

   TODO: VP9 description.  Please see [I-D.grange-vp9-bitstream].

2.  Conventions, Definitions and Acronyms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Layer Intra Request

   Editor's Note: The message described in this section is applicable to
   other codecs beyond just VP9.  In the future it will be likely be
   split out into another document.

   TODO: details of how this is encoded in RTCP.

   A synchronization frame can be requested by sending a LIR, which is
   an RTCP feedback message asking the encoder to encode a frame which
   makes it possible to upgrade to a higher layer.  The LIR message
   contains two tuples, {T1,S1,Q1} and {T2,S2,Q2}, where the first tuple
   is the currently highest layer the decoder can decode, while the
   second tuple is the layer the decoder wants to upgrade to.

   Identification of an upgrade frame can be derived from the reference
   IDs of each frame by backtracking the dependency chain until reaching
   a point where only decodable frames are being referenced.  Therefore

   it's recommended both for both the flexible and the non-flexible mode
   that, when upgrade frames are being encoded in response to a LIR,
   those packets should contain layer indices and the reference fields
   so that the decoder or an MCU can make this derivation.

   Example:

   LIR {1,1,0}, {1,2,1} is sent by an MCU when it is currently relaying
   {1,1,0} to a receiver and which wants to upgrade to {1,2,1}. In
   response the encoder should encode the next frames in layers {1,1,1}
   and {1,2,1} by only referring to frames in {1,1,0}, {1,0,0} or
   {0,0,0}.

   In the non-flexible mode, periodic upgrade frames can be defined by
   the layer structure of the SS, thus periodic upgrade frames can be
   automatically identified by the picture ID.

4.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550], and in any applicable RTP profile.  The main
   security considerations for the RTP packet carrying the RTP payload
   format defined within this memo are confidentiality, integrity and
   source authenticity.  Confidentiality is achieved by encryption of
   the RTP payload.  Integrity of the RTP packets through suitable
   cryptographic integrity protection mechanism.  Cryptographic system
   may also allow the authentication of the source of the payload.  A
   suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload format should
   provide confidentiality, integrity protection and at least source
   authentication capable of determining if an RTP packet is from a
   member of the RTP session or not.  Note that the appropriate
   mechanism to provide security to RTP and payloads following this memo
   may vary.  It is dependent on the application, the transport, and the
   signaling protocol employed.  Therefore a single mechanism is not
   sufficient, although if suitable the usage of SRTP [RFC3711] is
   recommended.  This RTP payload format and its media decoder do not
   exhibit any significant non-uniformity in the receiver-side
   computational complexity for packet processing, and thus are unlikely
   to pose a denial-of-service threat due to the receipt of pathological
   data.  Nor does the RTP payload format contain any active content.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to register the following values:
   - TODO.
